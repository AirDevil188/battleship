Battleship for "The Odin Project"

## notes

It was fun to learn about TDD concept, It's still a strange beast that's for sure, but I believe that as I write more code with this concept in mind I will only get better. Learning about Jest and how it works and why do we need TDD in general was really interesting.

And for my code, I think that in general the game logic code is okay and structure of it. But, the DOM was really hard, as it always is with vanilla JavaScript, I think that I could done better with the organization of my DOM logic. Especially with event listeners.

At first, I was thinking to implement a two player mode but in the end I scrapped that idea. One of the problems that I had with it was that I had to find a way how to hide ships placement on the game board from players. I had some "pass screen" in mind but in the end I didn't find a way yet to do that, maybe in future I will come back to it and implement this feature, when I'm done with the React and Node section.

I'm glad that I found the way to implement the placement of player ships by drag-drop, It wasn't a requirement but I decided to go in that rabbit-hole.

The CPU is kinda dum when attacking, but it does the job.

Game is not compatible on mobile screens for now but I will work on it.
